# CustomProgrammingLang
 
Hello everyone, that's a project, where I've been learning how compiler turns source code in assembler and have implemented my own C-like language. My custom language doesn't support all the various constructions of C languages, but it does have the basics: while loops, if statements, functions and recursion.
